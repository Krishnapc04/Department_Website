              <p>
                Since its inception in 1954, our Department is catering to the
                needs of the nation, especially in the area of human resource
                development and state of the art research. The Department has
                been renamed as Department of Metallurgical & Materials
                engineering from Department of Metallurgical Engineering in
                1994, to mark the progress of the Department in the area of
                exotic materials beyond conventional metals. We are proud that
                our Department is among the very few Institutes of excellence in
                India that stills embraces the classical metallurgy like iron
                and steel research along with advanced materials, which is the
                need of the nation today. Along with excellence in teaching our
                faculty members are addressing new important real-world
                challenges through introducing safer lithium-ion batteries,
                improved biomaterials and composites. Our faculty members are
                among the most cited in the world and are nationally and
                internationally recognized for excellence. Finally, I would like
                to thank all the sponsors of our research projects and
                activities in our Department that allow our program to thrive.
